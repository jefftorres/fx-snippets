The book explains about some of the core objects in JavaFX, things that might be used on a simple desktop app.

Contents on the chapter are mostly divided by those objects,
a `main` method has been included on each component to run separately.

The order of these components is:
1. SimplerHello
   - Hello world
2. FxControls
   - Labels 
   - Buttons
   - Events
3. Checkboxes
   - Checkboxes 
   - Indeterminate checkbox state
4. ListViews
   - Listviews 
   - Selectable items
5. TextFields
   - User input through textfields
6. EffectsAndTransforms
   - Rotation
   - Scaling
   - Blur
   - Reflections
